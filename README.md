# Python Mastery exercises

David Beazley put out a repo named [Advanced Python Mastery](https://github.com/dabeaz-course/python-mastery).

As I believe I'm a master of python, I'm checking to see that I can do most of these without aids (although I'll probably get bored and go back to building things before working through all exercises).
